# Bacteria Analysis 


# Overview
This is a dashboard displaying different types of bacteria, their frequency of the bacteria and the scrub frequency for each person's navel to compare 
what bacteria is similar or different from their said navel to bacteria located in pieces of beef. 

# Summary 
This is a study of how different bacteria can be syntiesized with bacteria found in beef. There are labs across the country that have the ability to chemically make meat from bacteria, algae, and fungi. The claim is that there is an microorganism found on the human bodu that will enhance the quality, texture, and taste of beef. Furthermore, the bacteria sufficent to make synthetic beef is found in a person's navel. We have gathered data which shows different bacteria from each person's navel. Also, we have constructed a dashboard displaying a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge summarizing the different types of bacteria, the population for each type of bacteria, and the washing frequency for each test subject's navels. 

From the looks of this webiste, we have extracted data from a JSON file giving an overview of annoyonamus test subjects and their respective bacteria and washing frequency.
